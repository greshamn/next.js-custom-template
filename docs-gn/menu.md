**UX Considerations for this Structure:**

*   **Clear Entry Points:** "Vetting Center" is the primary action hub. "Suppliers" and "Individuals" are key data repositories.
*   **Progressive Disclosure:** Top-level menus are broad. Clicking into a supplier/individual profile reveals more detailed, context-specific options (often as tabs within that profile page), preventing overwhelming the main sidebar.
*   **Role-Based Visibility:** The "Administration" section and certain sub-menus would only be visible to users with the appropriate permissions.
*   **Search:** A global search bar (in the header, not sidebar) would be essential to quickly find suppliers, individuals, or specific reports across the entire application.
*   **Breadcrumbs:** Crucial for helping users understand their location within the app, especially when navigating deep into profiles or settings.
*   **Wizard for "New Vetting Request":** This is a critical workflow. The wizard should guide the user step-by-step:
    1.  Identify Supplier (search existing or add new).
    2.  Identify related Individuals (if applicable, link existing or add new).
    3.  Select Checks: Present clear sections for "Individual Checks," "Company Checks," and "Business Location Verification," allowing users to select all relevant checks from the lists provided in your blueprint.
    4.  Confirm and Initiate.
