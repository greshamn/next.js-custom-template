For your reference this project is based for a south african company that is going to do vetting for their suppliers and staff. by vetting i mean security checks like id number verifcations, director of company checks, lifestyle checks and allot of other checks. I will also need to create pdf or excel reports based on the feedback from various vetting companies in south africa like MIE, CPB, LexisNexis and others.

My application must be security first, with very tight security measures and controls and be extremely strong against hacking and data leaks.

Calendar
Logs for checks that were done and the date and time and expiry of those checks
charts for the checks and perhaps groups that were completed for both individuals and suppliers
data cards
kpi cards
