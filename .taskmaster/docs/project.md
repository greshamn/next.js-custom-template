For your reference this project is based for a south african company that is going to do vetting for their suppliers and staff. by vetting i mean security checks like id number verifcations, director of company checks, lifestyle checks and allot of other checks. I will also need to create pdf or excel reports based on the feedback from various vetting companies in south africa like MIE, CPB, LexisNexis and others.

My application must be security first, with very tight security measures and controls and be extremely strong against hacking and data leaks.

Calendar
Logs for checks that were done and the date and time and expiry of those checks
charts for the checks and perhaps groups that were completed for both individuals and suppliers
data cards
kpi cards


Okay, here's a brief project description for "Vetted Pro" within the South African context:

**Project Description: Vetted Pro**

**We are building "Vetted Pro," a secure, AI-driven web platform designed to revolutionize supplier vetting and risk management for medium to large enterprises in South Africa.**

**What We Will Build:**

Vetted Pro will be a comprehensive Next.js application offering:

*   **Centralized Pre & Post-Vetting:** Streamlining verification of individuals (ID, criminal, credit) and businesses (CIPC, location, financials), including unique post-vetting analysis of RFP-to-invoice data to detect fraud.
*   **AI-Powered Insights & Reporting:** Leveraging LLMs to analyze vetting results, identify risks, and generate standardized, downloadable PDF reports.
*   **Robust Data Management:** Securely managing extensive supplier data, tracking ~100 vetting checks with validity periods, and supporting physical location verification with photo/GPS uploads.
*   **User-Friendly Interface:** A clean, responsive UI with light/dark themes, intuitive navigation, and powerful dashboards for visualizing complex data (e.g., risk scores, compliance status, vetting progress) using rich, interactive charts.
*   **Security & Compliance:** Built with a security-first approach, strong authentication, RBAC, and adherence to South African data laws like POPIA.

**South African Context:**

In South Africa, businesses face significant challenges with supplier fraud, compliance (e.g., BEE, POPIA), and ensuring the legitimacy of their supply chains, particularly in sectors like mining. Vetted Pro addresses this by:

*   Providing a **first-of-its-kind integrated platform** to combat these issues.
*   Supporting **local supplier development** by enabling robust verification, including physical address checks crucial for community upliftment initiatives.
*   Helping companies navigate complex **regulatory requirements** and mitigate risks associated with corruption and tender manipulation.

**In essence, Vetted Pro aims to be the definitive tool for South African businesses to ensure they are working with legitimate, compliant, and low-risk suppliers, enhancing efficiency and protecting against financial and reputational damage.**
